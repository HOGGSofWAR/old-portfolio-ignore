                                    <h2>Watershed Pervasive Media Studio: New Talent Residency</h2>
                                    <img src="/images/pmstudio.jpg" alt="">
                                    <p>In 2018 I was part of one of the few teams selected for the Pervasive Media Studio's New Talent Residency.</p>
                                    <p><a href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/residents/nicola-hogg">Click Here</a>  to see my Pervasive Media Studio Residency Profile</p>
                                    <p>This was a three month Research and Design residency. I was working alongside two others, writer Jo Kimber and sculptor Alec Stevens in brainstorming, designing and testing a mobile app that would navigate users around historically famous LGBTQ+ areas of central Bristol and giving the user audio stories to listen to within those locations. </p>
                                    <p>The idea was for the app to work like a radio device. We had tested the concept of a wooden dial to interact with the mobile screen like a radio dial, allowing users to tune in to a frequency to unlock an audio story.</p>
                                    <p>When navigated to particular areas of Bristol, the user would interact with a wooden sculpture which would be hidden in plain sight in that area, on the sculpture would be a number and if the user tuned into that number whilst in that specific GPS location, the associated audio story will play.</p>
                                    <p>Below is a trailer which was played at the end of the 3 month residency, to the public at the following event: <a href="https://www.watershed.co.uk/whatson/8842/new-talent-residencies-showcase/?fbclid=IwAR18QeMwIVS-E73Ip1lsMWHh6bX76TmVegXs2f6ROyw44vlBOnj69ht4cy8">The New Talent Residencies Showcase</a></p>
                                    <p>Please note, this trailer is more to give a clearer concept/demo of what our work would be like. I was responsible for filming and editing the video as well as producing the music and editing the audio files and any sound effects in the clips. However, this trailer was a last minute decision as we had some extra time before the presentation, so it was filmed and edited in about two hours, for better examples of my video work, please refer to my Adobe page.</p>

                                    <p>During the residency I used App furnace and Marvel to create some initial prototypes for the team.</p>
                                    <p>I then began working on developing C# skills which was a new language to me, I was Unity and focused mostly on getting a working demo of a radio dial which would respond to the wooden dial for the public talk night</p>
                                    <p>Alongside this, I also wrote and prepared most of the presentation as well as leading most of the talk in front of a sold out audience. I wrote two pieces of music especially for the project as well as using two previously made tracks to use in the edited audio files. I worked in Ableton to make edits to the demo audio recordings with temporary voice actors from a local university. As well as editing sound effects and my music to create a more immersive narrative audio clip.</p>
                                    <p>Here are some photos of people testing the demo with the sculpture on the night.</p>
